<h1 align="center">🍂 C++ Practice 🍂</h1>
<p align="center">A little practice console program to help learn the basics of c++ such as header files, but mostly pointers and references, which are two new concepts as c++ is my first non-memory managed language. Also helped to practice with less novel ideas such as cpp's implementation of inheretance, namespaces, and constructors</p>
